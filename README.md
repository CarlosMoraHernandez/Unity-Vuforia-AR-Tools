# Unity-Vuforia-AR-Tools

  This repo is a set of scripts I used for my [A Week A Project AR series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0TLPomkX3gjC_ulJZGIXQ).

  These scripts are mainly used for generating shadow and illusions in AR with Vuforia. There are a [few tutorials about lighting in AR](http://newyellowdev-en.blogspot.tw/2017/04/ar-light-and-shadow-with-projector.html) in my tech blog [Newyellow on Develop](http://newyellowdev-en.blogspot.tw/).
  
  And the [A Week A Project AR repo](https://github.com/newyellow/A-Week-A-Project-AR) is a whole Unity project demo that you can simply download and try the effect.
